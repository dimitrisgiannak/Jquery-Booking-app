## BOOKING APP 


* *The specific project was to design and replicate the following as closest as possible :* 
[Project image](img/project_img.png)

* *Each [number](img/toDo.png) explains what must be done.*

* *We where provided with a data.json file to consume data and display.We get them via ajax call.*

* *Designed on Google Chrome so for best experiance use this browser.*
*Works on Opera also.*
*On Mozilla some png icons do not work as intended(in calendars) so the outcome is not optimal. To start the project right click on index.html Open with: and select your browser. I used visual studio code Live Server extension to view the changes without refreshing the browser.*
* *I used grid layout as my first attempt.I'm sure there is a cleaner way to write the code but the outcome was what i had in mind.*
* *Our page is responsive.Hiding some icons or fields was intended.*
* *To check the responsiveness i used Responsive viewer extension from Google Chrome and tested it on multiple screens. Feel free to test with both width and height till it starts to get messy!*
* *Because we had limited data from our json file some fields are not required and we filled them with Lipsum generator.*
* *To match the colors i used Snagit.*

### Functionality

* *Our app meets the criteria given in the task.*
* *You need at least 3 letters for autocomplete to kick in. The search button also refreshes all the other fields to their default value. It doesn't take into account if any other options are picked.*
* *From number 4 to 7 and 9 you can use them as filters to find the desired entry.They don't work independedly meaning that if two or more filters are picked the entries will have to match in order to find the entry/ies.*
* *View-deal button has no specific function but it's clickable.*
